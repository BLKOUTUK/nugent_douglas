# 🎨 RGB Dual-Layer Encoder

A web-based tool for creating **dual-meaning images** inspired by Harlem Renaissance artists like **Richard Bruce Nugent** and **Aaron Douglas**, who created murals that changed meaning under different colored lights.

Students can draw or upload two images:
- **Red channel**: Hidden / intimate meaning
- **Blue channel**: Public / visible meaning

Encoded image shows both meanings together. Under red/blue light simulation, only one appears at a time.
