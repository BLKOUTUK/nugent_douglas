# üé® RGB Dual-Layer Encoder

A web-based tool for creating **dual-meaning images**, inspired by Harlem Renaissance artists like Richard Bruce Nugent and Aaron Douglas.

Students can draw or upload two grayscale images:
- **Layer A (Red)**: Hidden / intimate meaning
- **Layer B (Blue)**: Public / visible meaning

Encoded image shows both meanings together. Under red/blue light simulation, only one appears at a time.
